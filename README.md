# Random-VGY
## *a simple program to find random vgy.me screenshots*

- The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the public nature of such image sharing websites and to serve as a fun way to see random screenshots that users have posted.

- The program uses a multithreaded search function of random 6-character alphanumeric links for the image sharing site ***[vgy.me](https://vgy.me/)***.

> Approximately 100 searches per second are performed with default parameters.

> On average, it takes 550 seconds to find a "**hit**," after which the link is ***automatically opened*** in a new browser tab and hits are saved to a text file in the root directory.
